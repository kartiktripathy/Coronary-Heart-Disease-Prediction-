# Coronary-Heart-Disease-Prediction using Neural Networks
A project on predicting the happening of the coronary heart diseases in the upcoming years of an individual with the help of Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) with 3 layers of approach.
The model is trained on a dataset which has several features , to name a few ,BMI,Cholesterol Levels ,  Glucose Level, age, various previous medical history of the indvidual.
The model asks several questions and finally predicts wether there is a chance of you having any Coronary Heart disease in the upcoming future .
The model has an mean accuracy of 85%.
The model is quite useful and can be used by common people for self asssesment and by doctors to foresee the condition of their patients.
